-- -- Memantine pharmacology
-- Memantine is a low-affinity voltage-dependent non-competitive antagonist at glutamatergic NMDA receptors.
-- Glutamateric:
-- NMDAR antagonist with higher affinity than Mg++, ultimatly inhibits prolonged Ca++ influx
-- Serotonergic:
-- Non-competitive antagonist at 5-HT3 receptor, potency similar to that for the NMDA receptor
-- Cholinergic:
-- Non-competitive antagonist at nAChRs with potencies possibly similar to NMDA and 5-HT3 receptors
-- Dopaminergic:
-- Agonist at D2 receptor with equal or slightly higher affinity than NMDA receptors
-- Sigmaergic:
-- Agonist at Sigma-1 receptor with low Ki ~= 2.6 Î¼M (2600 nM)
-- Therapeutic concentrations of memantine are most likely too low to have any sigmaergic effect, as a typical therapeutic dose is 20mg.
-- Excessive doses of memantine (e.g. recreational use) may indeed activate Sigma-1 (https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Pharms_Memantine.shtml)
