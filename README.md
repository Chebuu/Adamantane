# Memantine Pharmacdynamics

## Central activity

### Glutamateric:
- Low-affinity voltage-dependent non-competitive antagonist at glutamatergic NMDA receptors
- NMDAR antagonist with higher affinity than Mg++, ultimatly inhibits prolonged Ca++ influx
### Serotonergic:
- Non-competitive antagonist at 5-HT3 receptor, potency similar to that for the NMDA receptor
### Cholinergic:
- Non-competitive antagonist at nAChRs with potencies possibly similar to NMDA and 5-HT3 receptors
### Dopaminergic:
- Agonist at D2 receptor with equal or slightly higher affinity than NMDA receptors
### Sigmaergic:
- Agonist at Sigma-1 receptor with low Ki ~= 2.6 Î¼M (2600 nM)
- Therapeutic concentrations of memantine are most likely too low to have any sigmaergic effect, as a typical therapeutic dose is 20mg.
- Excessive doses of memantine (e.g. recreational use) may indeed activate Sigma-1
